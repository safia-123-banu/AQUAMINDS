# Problem Statement:
Fish farmers face significant challenges in detecting and diagnosing diseases early, leading to substantial financial losses due to undetected outbreaks. Existing methods often require specialized knowledge and are not easily accessible to farmers with limited technical skills. This creates a gap in timely intervention, jeopardizing both fish health and farm profitability. An efficient, user-friendly solution is needed to help farmers identify potential health risks early and reduce losses, promoting more sustainable fish farming practices.

# Solution:
Our AI-powered platform addresses the challenge by providing fish farmers with an accessible tool to predict and diagnose diseases early. The system allows farmers to submit text descriptions, images of affected fish, and voice reports. Machine learning models, trained on historical fish health data, environmental conditions, and disease symptoms, analyze these inputs to deliver real-time predictions on potential health risks. Designed with a user-friendly interface, the platform enables farmers, even with limited technical skills, to monitor fish health efficiently, reducing losses and supporting more sustainable fish farming.


Our AI-powered platform enables fish farmers to predict and diagnose diseases early through a user-friendly interface. Farmers can submit text, images, and voice reports, which are analyzed by machine learning models trained on fish health data and environmental conditions. The platform delivers real-time predictions, helping farmers reduce losses and promote sustainable fish farming, even with limited technical skills.

# About Our AI Model:
Our AI model is specifically designed to analyze multi-modal inputs—text, images, and voice reports—provided by fish farmers. Trained on vast datasets of historical fish health records, environmental factors, and disease symptoms, the model uses advanced machine learning techniques to detect patterns and predict potential health risks in real-time. It incorporates convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image analysis and natural language processing (NLP) for text and voice inputs. The model continuously learns from new data, improving its accuracy and ensuring that predictions are relevant to current conditions, offering farmers a reliable tool for disease management.
